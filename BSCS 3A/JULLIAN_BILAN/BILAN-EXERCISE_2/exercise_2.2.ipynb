      "139. Friendly?\n",
      "140. Will strikes a deal for these and upholds it with honor. Yet you're the one standing here with the prize. Full pardon, commission as a privateer on behalf of England and the East India Trading Company. As if I could be bought for such a low price. \n",

      "147. One word love: curiosity. You long for freedom. You long to do what you want to do because you want it. To act on selfish impulse. You want to see what it's like. One day, you won't be able to resist.\n",
      "148. Uh my Compass works fine. \n",
      "149. I *love* those moments. I like to wave at them as they pass by.\n",
